# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Final-Project
In this course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, The given R code downloads the data set if it isn't present already and classifies the labels and features. It then loads both the training and testing data and keeps only those columns that reflect a mean or std. deviation. Lastly, it merges the 2 datasets and converts the subject and activity columns into factors and thus creating a tidy dataset that contains the mean for each variable. 

Final output is shown in the text file 'tidy.txt' .
